MY name is yang si yuan. I born in 1998. When I was a little girl, I was a shy girl.

I graduated in Shuen Tian Guo Shian.  
I makes some friends in there, but we have a few times no met each other.  

After six years, I attended Taichia Middle School, where is in Taichia town in Taichung.
I kwow my teacher. She is an enthusiastic and knowledgeable teacher.
Because of her teaching, I become more mature.
In addition to this, I know my best friend. We had fun every day. This is a memory that I will never forget.

Because of the distance of my home and school. I choosed Taichai high school in my town.
I studied hard to attend a outstanding university, and I was successful to attend National Cheng Kung University.
Hence, I have to leave from my friends and my city, where I have lived seventeen years.

I go to Tainan by train, which takes me approximately three hours. In the beginning, I was unfamiliar with everything.
Crossed period of time, I gradually become more and more independent and enjoy my life in college.
The life in university is differ from that in the past. It is more colorful and free.
Hope I can know more people from all over the world and learn more professional knoeledge.
